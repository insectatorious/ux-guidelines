# Introduction

The following is a list of some simple guidelines to keep in mind when building user interfaces.

- no hidden state
- be flexible, allow the user to make mistakes and undo where possible
- have a clear call-to-action on each 'view' of the interface
- error messages should be clear with suggestions to remove the error
- use appropriate user interface tools (drop downs, sliders text boxes etc) for input
- don't put conflicting buttons next to each other. Save and cancel should not suffer from misclicks.
- the user should know what clicking/tapping on the interface will do, do not make the user guess

Each bullet point is explained in more detail.
